Features not done:
1. Monster can shoot bullets
2. Disappearing platforms
3. Zoom feature

Best performance in Chrome.

Audio cannot play if the next sound clip is activated too fast after the previous one (e.g. try killing monsters in quick succession).

I didn't separate out the files into game.html and game.js. Code quality is not good either. Sorry about that.
