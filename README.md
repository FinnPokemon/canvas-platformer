# My Little Platformer

A platform game created using HTML5 Canvas API and grit. Just double click on game.html to play.

## Features:

1. You can shoot
2. You can teleport
3. A pesky intelligent bat which will be chasing you
4. Multiple levels and highscore board
5. God mode

## Features to be done:

1. Monster can shoot bullets
2. Disappearing platforms

## Misc.

Best performance in Chrome.

Audio cannot play if the next sound clip is activated too fast after the previous one (e.g. try killing monsters in quick succession).

I didn't separate out the files into game.html and game.js. Code quality is not good either. Sorry about that.
